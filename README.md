- [Won't Fix] AI unable to up-find-remote wild-camel/wild-camel-class
- [Fixed] up-get-fact / up-get-focus-fact / up-get-target-fact / up-get-player-fact   don't return true
- [Fixed] counting buildings (dynamically) does not include pending
- [Fixed] up-create-group unable to assign to an empty list
- [Fixed] unable to count other players' organ-gun-line/gbeto-line/gbeto/organ-gun/elite-organ-gun (retuns -1) but elite-gbeto works
- [Fixed] counting other players' barracks huskarl or elite barracks huskarl returns -1, counting huskarl-set returns 2 less than expected
- [Fixed] object-data-move-x/y not working when object not moving
- [Partially Fixed] DUC finding ally buildings [building-class/all-units-class finds all the pieces of TC (109, 618, 619, 620, 1649) instead of just 109]
- [Partially Fixed] up-get-object-type-data: object-data-speed doesnt work and returns -2, object-data-dropsite incorrectly gives 109 (town-center) when it shouldnt be avilable for this command [object-data-dropsite gives 68 (mill) whereas it should be something like -1]
- [Partially Fixed] up-get-object-data: object-data-train-site not working for villagers (including idle villager type), object-data-dropsite bugged for villagers (always gives 109 (town-center)) when it should give mill, lumber camp, or mining camp depending on what it was assigned to [object-data-gather-type still has the same bug as before where it doesnâ€™t change until the villager starts gathering the new resource. It needs to change immediately when the villager is assigned to the new resource.]
- [Fixed] creating scenario with x players, saving, new SP start, exit, add player to map, save, exit, enter SP lobby -> crash
- [Fixed] timers bugged when setting to negative value
- [Fixed] game crash without error box if constant is undefined

- cant queue techs one after another, only a tech and a unit (fixed?)
- up-assign-builders for palisade wall and stone-wall doesnt work (fixed?)
- up-object-type-count/-total broken (does not account for pending structures being built and maybe units too?) - up-object-type-count/-total broken for anything that isnt a unit-line or building-line with exception to villagers and gates
- many ResourceAmount constants defined by DE inconsistent with UserPatchConst.per constant definitions
- up-find-resource broken ((up-find-resource c: -1 c: 40) causes a crash) (fixed?)
- tc ungarrison onto deer (up-gather-inside c: town-center c: -1) prevents gather points from being set
- up-create-group when the local list includes garrisoned units does not work correctly, any garrisoned units will be excluded from the goup
- object-data-gather-type is only set when villager starts gathering when it should be set immediately when it is assigned. it does reset "correctly" to -1 when villager is returning from the camp after dropping off their resources
- object-data-action-time behaves differently in DE but its also bugged in UP
- old battering ram id (35) no longer works for DUC since feudal battering ram was added as the base unit (is warning)
- unable to DUC find ally/enemytrade carts
- (sn-ignore-tower-elevation 0) still does not prefer high elevation
- (up-get-point position-enemy gl-target-point-x) does not get nearest target player building (ex. castle)
- place-control works differently in DE compared to UP, sometimes buildiings are placed in back instead of preferred front
- clicking on own ai trade carts causes massive fps tank
- (generate-random-number 0) crashes DE
- tsa bug: units moving toward (-1,-1) with action-attack (apparently DUC leak)
- unit ungarrison from ram paused and when ram gets destroyed by enemy; units set to action-attack but units stand there with no idle animation (object-data-idling is 0)
- id loop search for boars failing in DE (barb boar search code), UP works fine (object id assignment different between verisons?)
- rally points; unable to go from house to house, tower to house: garrison type?
- rules being skipped
- players in treaty no longer considered allies by the AI, causing unexpected behavior
- place-point makes buildings placed far from target point, even with small placement zone size
- map eyecandy (tree on water) causing game crash upon hovering with mouse
- setting promotional picture for a mod to make mod public, game crashes
- villagers going to boar on opposite part of map regardless of LOS (uncapped max hunt distance).
- DUC searching for Ally markets not returning the market (fixed in earlier PUP build?)
- extreme ai doesnt shoot arrows (garrisoned) when upping to next age
- changing color of a player in scenario causes spawn at random location on map
- up-chat-data-to-player inconsistencies with formatting
- up-log-data is broken "invalid negative master object id passed -1"
- AI Game Perspective Switching with chat messages focus stuck on Player 1 and all P1's perspective data
- up-build with a goal set to with-escrow doesnt allow AI to use escrowed resources to place buildings (no foundation) until the building can be placed without escrowed resources
- load-random with '+' load feature doesnt work; script sub-file doesnt get loaded (Meleon)
- taunts 15 and 18 are incorrect sounds; being rushed, enemy sighted wrong (and possibly others)
- setting sn-number-boat-explore-groups to 0 doesnt stop the first trained ship from exploring
- one villager remaining forced to explore
- up-build not as reliable in DE? - negative sn-placement-fail-delta causing incorrect placement and build delay

- classes dont work for up-set-offensive-priority, despite scripter64 documentation
- trebuchet set counting wrong
- 2 villagers explore and 1 to build houses, when houses finish, it gathers sheep despite gatherers capped at 0 - in UP villagers correctly starts exploring after finishing houses
- position-flank has offset x coords 0-12 higher than what it should be, UP seems to use mirrored flank position
- position-mirror gives position-opposite effect instead of position-mirror
- Resetting Offense Priorities each pass causes a crash
- Chat Box Lag for Win11 users, letters cant be typed until after delay
- action-stop can cause a crash
- there are cases where the path distance calculation is wrong (path distances on arena f.e. not always showing that objects inside the enemy's walled town were inaccessible)
- idle-farm-count yielding negative values on map water nomad (one farm is occupied, returns -1, two farms returns -2)
