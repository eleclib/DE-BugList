- up-chat-data-to-player inconsistencies with formatting
- up-log-data is broken "invalid negative master object id passed -1"
- AI Game Perspective Switching with chat messages focus stuck on Player 1 and all P1's perspective data
- up-build with a goal set to with-escrow doesnt allow AI to use escrowed resources to place buildings (no foundation) until the building can be placed without escrowed resources
- load-random with '+' load feature doesnt work; script sub-file doesnt get loaded (Meleon)
- taunts 15 and 18 are incorrect sounds; being rushed, enemy sighted wrong (and possibly others)
- setting sn-number-boat-explore-groups to 0 doesnt stop the first trained ship from exploring
- one villager remaining forced to explore
- up-build not as reliable in DE? - negative sn-placement-fail-delta cuasing incorrect placement and build delay
- dropsite-min-disstance deer-hunting returning 255 instead of -1   as well as hunting, boar-hunting and live-boar
- classes dont work for up-set-offensive-priority, despite scripter64 documentation
- trebuchet set counting wrong
- 2 villagers explore and 1 to build houses, when houses finish, it gathers sheep despite gatherers capped at 0 - in UP villagers correctly starts exploring after finishing houses
- position-flank has offset x coords 0-12 higher than what it should be, UP seems to use mirrored flank position
- position-mirror gives position-opposite effect instead of position-mirror
- Resetting Offense Priorities each pass causes a crash
- Chat Box Lag for Win11 users, letters cant be typed until after delay
